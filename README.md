Description

A total of 44 healthy elderly and MCI and AD patients participated in this experiment. The data of 6 participants were removed from further processing due to issues with EEG data recording, history of stroke, or traumatic brain injuries. Also, participants with any history of olfactory dysfunction were excluded from the study. The remaining 35 participants (age = 70.97±8.58, female = 57.14%) included 15 healthy (normal) individuals (age = 69.27±6.65, female = 53.33%), 7 MCI patients (age = 66.57±6.85, female = 51.14%), and 13 AD patients (age = 75.31±9.90, female = 61.54%).
An olfactory oddball perception task was performed on the participants. During this task, each participant was presented with a random sequence of two different odors. The sequence of odors was the same for all participants. One odor (lemon) was presented frequently (standard) with a probability of 0.75 and the other odor (rose) was presented non-frequently (deviant) with a probability of 0.25.

The dataset consists of four files as follows: 
1)	“AD.mat”: Contains data for Alzheimer’s disease patients.
2)	“Normal.mat”: Contains data for healthy elderly participants. 
3)	“MCI.mat”: Contains data for amnestic mild cognitive impairment patients. 
4)	“MMSE_Data”: Contains demographic and MMSE data of all participants.

The structure of the first three files is the same as described below. These files are organized as structure arrays for use in MATLAB coding. However, the data can also be used with other programming languages like python (using the scipy package).

The fourth file includes demographic data of each participant as age in a range, their diagnosed mental state, and the details of their MMSE score. The columns indicate abbreviated MMSE test components as follows: O Place: Orientation to Place, O Time: Orientation to time, Reg: Registration, Att & Calc: Attention and Calculation, Rep: Repetition, DR: Delayed Recall, VS: Visuospatial, Comm: Commands.
